# sde2json

This is a tool for converting the [EVE static data export](https://eveonline-third-party-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sde/index.html) to JSON format. It has been udpated to the Citadel release of the SDE and converts the new YAML and staticdata (map/universe) version of the SDE. It does not rely on the legacy DB3/SQL version of the SDE.

It is used primarily to create JSON data files compatible with [EVEoj](https://eve-oj.com/).

This has been ported from previous [sdd2json C tool](https://github.com/xyjax/sdd2json).
